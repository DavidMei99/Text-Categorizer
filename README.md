# Text-Categorizer

This is a Natural Language Processing project for the course ECE467 offered by the Cooper Union. Specific requirements are shown in the file "NLP_Spring2020_Project1.docx". My program applies Rocchio/TF*IDF method to conduct text categorization. The directory "corpus1" and perl script "analyze.pl" (both are created by Professor Carl Sable) is used to test the performance of the program. To run the program, simply type "python tc_rocchio_tfidf" in the terminal.
